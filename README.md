research on the NDN platform. Based on [Mini-NDN](https://github.com/named-data/mini-ndn) which
is a fork of [Mininet-wifi](https://github.com/mininet/mininet), MiniNDN-WiFi uses the NDN libraries,
NFD, NLSR, and tools released by the [NDN project](http://named-data.net/codebase/platform/)
to emulate an NDN network on a single system.
